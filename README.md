This is a file-synchronization system with large, efficiency, trusty properties.

File synchronization is widely applied in applications with the function of providing
filedownloading and file uploading. Softwares such as Dropbox, Baidu Netdisk, Ali Cloud,
have the rudimentary function of file synchronization with breakpoint resume, partiallyupdate 
along with encryption methods to ensure security. To provide file synchronizationbetween devices,
network programming enables the interaction between differentcomputers, which mainly containing
file transferring protocols. This report willdemonstrate the process of implementing a file
synchronization application includingseveral transferring protocols between three hosts using
python network programmingalong with the testing methods and results. Also, further improvement
plan with beintroduced.
